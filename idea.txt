// create logger with pino 
Due to Node's single-threaded event-loop, it's highly recommended that sending, alert triggering, reformatting, and all forms of log processing are conducted in a separate process or thread.

In Pino terminology, we call all log processors "transports" and recommend that the transports be run in a worker thread using our pino.transport API.

in many cases, Pino is over 5x faster than alternatives.

//create utility env parser in common
This env.ts file is a utility module for type-safe environment variable validation and parsing in your Node.js/TypeScript monorepo. Here's what it does:

for ex:
import { createEnv } from '@chatapp/common/src/env';
import { z } from 'zod';

const envSchema = z.object({
  PORT: z.string().transform(Number),
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
});

const env = createEnv(envSchema, { serviceName: 'auth' });
// env is now typed: { PORT: number; DATABASE_URL: string; }

pnpm --filter @chatapp/auth-service dev

//shutdown gracefully --> process.on(siginit,shutdown)



//request validations with zod
